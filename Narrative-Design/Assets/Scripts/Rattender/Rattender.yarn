Bartender: Welcome to the Tavern, pal. Need a drink?

-> Plubby: No, thank you.
    Bartender: Not thirsty, huh? Then why'd you come here?
-> Plubby: Just a glass of water please.
    Bartender: Coming right up.

Plubby: You must hear a lot of gossip as a Bartender.
Bartender: Maybe I do, why? You a cop?

-> Plubby: No, but I have some questions.
    <<jump Questions>>
-> Plubby: Yes I am.

Bartender: What'd you wanna know?

-> Plubby: What do you know about humans?
    Bartender: Terrible creatures, those humans. They keep chopping down more and more of the forest without regard for the rest of us who live here. I heard they wiped out most of our food supply with their last expansion.
    <<jump Questions>>
-> Plubby: What do you know about the rat king?
    Bartender: The king? He's alright I guess. Can't really blame him for the food shortage when the humans are the ones destroying things. I heard he's looking for someone to help forage for more supplies.
    <<jump Questions>>
-> Plubby: What do you know about the river blockage?
    Bartender: The water has been blocked by a tree the humans cut down. River's almost completly dried up! I heard the workers sent to move it are on strike due to the food shortage.
    <<jump Questions>>
-> Plubby: That's all for now.
    Bartender: Alright, see ya pal.
